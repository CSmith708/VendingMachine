# VendingMachine

Develop a class diagram for a vending machine. Make sure to include all the class data members and method members (constructors, setters, getters, and actions), with their proper access modifiers. Include this diagram in the IntelliJ project as a pdf file type so that it gets pushed into the repository as VMclassDiagram.pdf
Please include enums too to help describe the product categories. 
In IntelliJ create the classes for the vending machine from your class diagram. Make sure it compiles and runs.  Capture it compiling and running and upload the screen pdf to your project so it is included in the repository VMcompile.pdf & VMrunning.pdf. Make sure that I can read it too.
Check in all the IntelliJ code to your github project and submit the URL for the assignment
